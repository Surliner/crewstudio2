The ERP's modular structure means that RAGNI can implement additional functionalities as required, such as customer relationship management (CRM) tools to enhance client engagement or supply chain management systems to manage logistics more effectively. This scalability will ensure that RAGNI can support its expansion efforts while maintaining a strong operational backbone.
