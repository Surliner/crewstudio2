Hi Stéphane,

I hope this email finds you well! 

I wanted to take a moment to share some exciting benefit ideas for implementing Sage X3 at RAGNI that could really make a difference:

1. **Enhanced Operational Efficiency**: By migrating all operational data to a single platform, we can reduce data silos and streamline access. With automated workflow solutions, we could cut down on manual inputs and errors, envisioning a 50% reduction in data retrieval times!

2. **Cost Savings through Resource Optimization**: With Sage X3’s powerful inventory management capabilities, we can optimize stock levels and minimize holding costs. Imagine achieving a 20% decrease in inventory costs within just a year!

3. **ERP Enhancements for Scalability**: We can modularly implement Sage X3, starting with the essentials and gradually incorporating advanced features. With thorough training and support, we can ensure that our team fully utilizes the system efficiently.

I'd love to discuss these ideas further with you. How about a quick call this week? 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
